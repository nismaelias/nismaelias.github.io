<p>
    Hello! My name is Nisma Elias. I am a PhD Candidate in the Comparative and International Development Education (CIDE) program at the University of Minnesota, minoring in Evaluation Studies. 
<p>  
Prior to my PhD, I worked for a number of years in East Africa as a Research Economist in education policy. Before that, I was based in Washington D.C. where I worked for the Education Global Practice at the World Bank. 
<p>
My research focuses on investigating the ways in which educatinal institutions explicitly work for the privileged. This includes the ways in which privileged groups actively work on their own behalf to construct and maintain distinction, particularly thorugh the use of private tutoring. My research interests include: the socialization of privilege, equity in and access to schooling, the role of shadow education or private tutoring, as well as the privatization of education.
